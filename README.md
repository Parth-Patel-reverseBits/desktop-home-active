🚀 Space Tourism Website 🌍

I’ve developed a space tourism website using pure HTML and CSS, designed to work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The complete source code is available in my GitHub repository, and the website is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and viewing.

Feel free to check out the site and explore the project.
